		<p>Orbital Weapons is a California-based startup founded with the idea of redistributing the power of destruction. Only a few human beings in the world can afford to have a sattelite orbiting the Earth, ready to strike at a moment's notice with a payload capable of leveling cities. Not anymore. We give that power to regular people.</p>
		<p>Do you desperately want a city annihilated, but cannot possibly afford your own space cannon? Worry not, because there are others like you who want it gone. When enough people come together and all pitch in to have a place leveled, our low orbit ion cannons will strike. The crowdfunding aspect of our service is what makes it sustainable. You can think of our product as Uber Pool, but for large-scale devastation.</p>
